```{r setup}
library(gitlabr)
```

With `gitlabr::use_gitlab_ci()` you can create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of your project. 
This file is used by GitLab CI/CD to manage your pipelines.

In 'gitlabr', there are different types of templates available.

```{r}
# Templates available
list.files(system.file("gitlab-ci", package = "gitlabr"))
```

Types available are:

- `"check-coverage-pkgdown"`: Check package along with
Code coverage with 'covr' and 'pkgdown' site on GitLab Pages
- `"check-coverage-pkgdown-renv"`: Check package built in a fixed 'renv' state
 along with Code coverage with 'covr' and 'pkgdown' site on GitLab Pages.
- `"bookdown"`: Build 'bookdown' HTML and PDF site on GitLab Pages
- `"bookdown-production"`: Build 'bookdown' HTML and PDF site on GitLab Pages.
 Where there will be a version of the book for each branch deployed.
See <https://github.com/statnmap/GitLab-Pages-Deploy> for setup details.


Hence, if you develop a R package, you can use the `"check-coverage-pkgdown"` template to check your package and deploy the documentation on GitLab Pages. Default image used is `image = "rocker/verse:latest"`.  
You can change parameters of `use_gitlab_ci()` but there shouldn't be reasons to change the ".gitlab-ci.yml" file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file with the template
gitlabr::use_gitlab_ci(template = "check-coverage-pkgdown")
```

If you wrote a bookdown book, you can use the `"bookdown"` template to build the HTML and PDF site on GitLab Pages.
The CI will detect packages used in the book and install them.  

In the ".gitlab-ci.yml" file, you can choose the output of your book.
By default, the "bookdown::bs4_book", "bookdown::gitbook" (commented), "bookdown::pdf_book" and "pagedown::html_paged" outputs are created. You can comment the outputs you don't want to build.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file with the template
gitlabr::use_gitlab_ci(template = "bookdown")
```
